                              <p style="font-size:180%;"> 
                                As someone who has experienced a great deal of hate within my three years of playing Krunker, 
                                I have learned a thing or two on how to handle it. First, allow me to make an introduction. 
                                I go by Aflack, which many of you may know me as the person with the highest shotgun level 
                                in the game. The Vince class has undergone many changes throughout Krunker’s history; however, 
                                the dislike towards the class has stayed relatively strong throughout its lifetime. Using 
                                this class often comes with the added consequence of receiving some rather colorful commentary 
                                from other members of the community. With that in mind, I would like to offer my advice and give
                                my thoughts on how to handle any hate you may receive while playing.
                              </p>
                                
                              <p style="font-size:180%;"> 
                                First thing’s first, if you don’t want to be subjected to any verbal harassment, 
                                I would recommend you go to your Settings (be sure to have the Advanced settings enabled) 
                                then click Display, scroll down until you see the Show Chat Box setting and click Off. 
                                This will disable chat so you don’t have to deal with anyone who may insult you. This 
                                obviously has some drawbacks as you won’t be able to have any interactions with people 
                                which can be a big downside as not everyone in the game is going to be rude to you. 
                                People can also send you messages via a kr gift which has been done to me on several occasions. So while this option may not entirely eliminate any harassment towards you, it is likely the best way you could avoid it.   
                              </p>
                              
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                For those who still want to interact with people, there are some other methods 
                                you could utilize that may help. The method I like using the most is to simply 
                                agree with the person who is insulting me. Let’s say someone says that I suck. 
                                All I would have to do is agree with them. This could either infuriate them more, 
                                make them ignore you, or, depending on the person, it could make them lighten up 
                                and allow a more civilized conversation to ensue. If the person continues to spew 
                                hateful words at you, just keep agreeing with them and more often than not they tend 
                                to leave the lobby.
                              </p>

                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                You can also choose to ignore the individual or people who are insulting you. 
                                Some people tend to look for a reaction when trying to provoke others so not giving 
                                one may leave them with no reason to continue with their actions. In some cases I 
                                like to ask the person why they are insulting me. In a fair amount of cases the person 
                                will apologize as they have just been getting agitated from the game. From there, it 
                                will be easier to communicate with them as they will have become more open to talking 
                                in an amicable way.
                              </p>

                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                And finally, while I don’t recommend it, you could always just be mean back. It’s 
                                called trash talking for a reason. I don’t recommend doing this though because it’s 
                                only really fighting fire with fire. The other methods have the option of leading to a 
                                more peaceful or uneventful outcome. But at the end of the day, when someone is insulting 
                                you, just know that you are allowed to do what you want to do. Other people shouldn’t get 
                                what they want just because they are unhappy with what you want to do. I hope these various 
                                approaches will help you whenever you are faced with any hate in the future.
