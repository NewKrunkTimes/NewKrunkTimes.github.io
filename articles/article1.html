                                  The map BetterSubzero is going to be added to rotation, replacing the current Subzero map. This rework was originally made by JermHunter who has also made the other recent map reworks including Burg and Oasis. This map was also worked on by MoonJuice who made the version of burg before the most recent one. Yesterday (April 27) MoonJuice confirmed in MMOK that this Subzero rework has already been approved by the devs. 
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:140%;">
                                Subzero was added back in March of 2019 in update 1.1.0 and has had very few updates since its initial release. This rework does not change much of the layout but has several design changes. The reworked map is set at a ski resort at the top of a mountain. The church has not been removed at the request of Sidney, but has ski moguls built on top of it. 
As well as to the design, changes have been made to certain areas to improve movement. The entrance to the church has been widened and the benches have been rearranged so you wonâ€™t be tripping over them anymore!
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:140%;">
                                The map is published in its current form as BetterSubzero, but it is still being updated. Keep in mind that this is not an accurate representation of the final map.
