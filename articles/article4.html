                                Some Krunker players may have seen the recent anti-cheat idea submission in the Krunker Bunker Discord server. 
The submitter’s idea was for the devs to implement impossibly small hitboxes in the sky to distract hackers and kick them when hit. His submission was denied. Why? We can only speculate. However, I have a few ideas as to why. I have prepared a few possible reasons as to why this seemingly good idea was denied.

                                <strong>Idea 1</strong><br>  
                                This player’s anti-cheat idea may have been denied because of the small chance that some new players could accidentally shoot the small hitboxes, not knowing how to aim and shooting the sky instead. This can be a serious problem because of the fact that all current Krunker weapons (apart from the knife, both held and thrown) have spray variation. This means that even if one does not particularly aim at the hitboxes, a stray bullet could still hit one and an innocent player could be booted from the server, inducing a very bad player experience. Spray patterns also lead me to my next idea as to why this idea was denied.
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                <strong>Idea 2</strong><br> 
                                Hackers aiming straight at the hitboxes will miss. Keep in mind, hackers are also players, too. They just aim differently. This means that weapon spray patterns apply to them too. If an aimbot is aiming directly at a sky hitbox, the gun has a very high chance of missing, unless a sniper is used, in which case it has a slightly lower chance of missing. Still, most hackers use weapons other than the sniper, like the AK or the SMG. These weapons have quite large spray patterns if you consider at what distance these hitboxes are going to be at.
                              </p>

                                <strong>Conclusion</strong><br> 
                                As you can see, this user’s ideas were good in theory, but as you dig deeper, they may not be so good in practice.
