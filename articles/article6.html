                              Even more weapons are going to be added to the game very soon! 
                                Many people have been asking for more content in krunker and boy are 
                                they delivering. Tehchy has been revealing more new kill streaks and 
                                weapons over the past few days. Some lower tier secondaries and killstreaks 
                                have already been added to the game, but now it’s time for the real game 
                                changers.

                              <h1>Refill</h1>
                              
                              <p style="font-size:180%;"> 
                                This one is going to be a slot 1 killstreak and is probably the most 
                                requested killstreak or update to knives since knife throwing came out. 
                                Yes, you will finally be able to refill your knife for another throw. 
                                With this you can refill your knife when you reach a five player killstreak. 
                                You most likely will only get one refill as it would be a little overpowered 
                                to let players throw their knives once every five kills, but it is a possibility. </p>
                              
                              <h1>War Machine</h1> 
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                The War Machine will probably be a slot 2 killstreak. It will probably 
                                be called in on a 15 killstreak. The War Machine is a grenade launcher
                                with similar physics to the Noob Toob secondary. It has 6 ammo and will 
                                disappear once you launch all 6 shots. A direct hit from the grenade 
                                does at least 100 damage so it can one shot most classes. The bomb 
                                explodes on impact and the explosion is larger than a Noob Tube or RPG 
                                explosion. It does anywhere from 40-60 damage to players depending on 
                                where they are in the explosion so you can kill most players in 2 shots 
                                if you do not hit them directly. This will most likely do damage to the 
                                person shooting these explosions as well if you are hit by your own 
                                explosion so be careful!
                              </p>
                              <h1>Bombardment</h1> 
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                First revealed on a stream by Zomballr, the Bombardment kill streak 
                                has been in the works for weeks now. Bombardment will be a slot 3 kill 
                                streak and classic nuke but it gets the job done. Instead of instantly 
                                killing everything alive, an airstrike flies overhead and drops a rain 
                                of bombs on the entire map. 
                                The bombs explode on the ground dealing damage to 
                                everyone who couldn’t find proper cover. The damage is similar to the 
                                War Machine, it can kill people from explosion damage in 2 shots and a 
                                direct hit can most likely one shot. 
                              </p>
                              <h1>Akimbo Secondary</h1> 
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                A new secondary is going to be added as well, we do not know the name 
                                of this but it appears to be quite powerful. 
                                This secondary looks like the uzis as you hold 2 of them, one in each hand. 
                                You most likely can not use ADS with this 
                                secondary similar to uzis and has a similar range as well. It is not automatic 
                                like the pistol but its fire rate is slower. Headshots deal 16 damage at the 
                                closest range and body shots do 9. The damage depends a lot on range though 
                                and this secondary is only really effective up close.
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                Remember that everything is still in testing and all are subject to change.
                              </p>
