                                The latest few Krunker updates have brought 3 exciting new weapons. One is a secondary, and the other 2 are brand new killstreak powerups and/or weapons. Krunker has had many updates to killstreaks recently, lately including the new customization system for selecting killstreaks. In addition, 2 new ones have been also added this week.

<h1>Slimer</h1>

<p style="font-size:180%;"> 
The first of these is a Slot 2 killstreak called the Slimer. The Slimer can replace the airdrop as slot 2 killstreak and can be called in on a 10 player killstreak. The killstreak is very different from the classic nuke or airdrop, it is a whole new weapon. This weapon shoots slime stains that boost players off of them similar to a boost pad. The weapon has 2 ammo and once both of these shots are used, the weapon disappears. Compared to the alternative airdrop, many players think this killstreak is useless as airdrops can be used to lure in a lot of players and make it easier to drop nukes. Some of the more experienced movement players however are excited for this new killstreak as it can make for some exciting new (out)plays and awesome trickshots.</p>

<h1>Juggernaut</h1> <p style="font-size:180%;">  
<img src="/images/juggernaut.png" width=256px style="float:right; margin: 10px; border-radius:10px;">

The latest killstreak added is a slot 3 killstreak called the Juggernaut. The Juggernaut can replace the nuke as Slot 3 killstreak and can be called in on a 30 player killstreak. The killstreak is very different from the classic nuke however, as it is a whole new weapon just like the Slimer. This weapon quite literally makes the player a Juggernaut, boosting your HP to 1000 no matter what class you are using, and giving you an overpowered minigun that can absolutely melt every player in your path with its impressive rate of fire. This upgrade lasts for a whopping 20 seconds, but these upgrades do not come without any drawbacks, as when you upgrade to the Juggernaut your movement speed is nerfed to about as slow as an LMG, and jumping is disabled. In a full lobby especially in team based modes like hardpoint or deposit where enemies come straight to you, this Juggernaut can bring in a lot more kills than a nuke, but in an Free For All lobby where movement is most important, many players would much rather keep their speed and stick with the class nuke for their 25 player killstreak. </p>


<h1>Zapper</h1> <p style="font-size:180%;"> 
<img src="/images/zapper.png" width=250px style="float:right; margin: 10px; border-radius:50px; background-color:#212121;">     
The newest secondary added to Krunker is called the Zapper. The Zapper unlocks at level 35. The Zapper is one of the most unique weapons in Krunker.io right now. To shoot, you must ADS to charge it up like a crossbow or a throwing knife. The charge time is significantly longer than the crossbow or knife. The Zapper on full charge does 5 damage, but gives the enemy the zap effect which deals the same damage repeatedly for 3 seconds which likens the Poison effect. So unlike most secondaries where you whip it out to get in as much damage as possible when you run out of ammo in your primary, the Zapper is most effective to use before you pull out your primary. The Zapper can make getting kills a lot easier, especially on tankier classes. Unfortunately though, as of right now you can not get a kill just with the taze from the Zapper. When you hit someone with the Zapper, the initial damage counts towards your damage, but if they are killed by the electricity and not with your bullet, they simply die as if they had jumped into the void and you do not earn xp for your kill. This will probably be patched in the future though.
