                              The latest Krunker update have brought 2 brand new killstreak 
                                powerups and/or weapons. Krunker has had many updates to 
                                killstreaks recently, including the new customization system 
                                for selecting killstreaks. 2 new ones were added last week. 
                              <img src="/images/slimer.png" width=250px style="float:right; margin: 10px; border-radius:50px; background-color:#212121;">     
                              <h1>Slimer</h1>
                              
                              <p style="font-size:180%;"> 
                                The first of these is a Slot 2 killstreak called the Slimer. 
                                The Slimer can replace the airdrop and can be called in on a 10 
                                player killstreak. The killstreak is very different from the classic 
                                nuke or airdrop, as it is a whole new weapon. This weapon shoots slime 
                                stains that boosts players off of them (similar to a boost-pad). 
                                The weapon lets the player shoot twice, and once both of these shots 
                                are used, the weapon disappears. Many players think this killstreak is useless but s
                                some of the more experienced movement players are excited for 
                                this new killstreak as it can make for some exciting new (out)plays and 
                                awesome trickshots. It may be worth mentioning that the slime shots 
                                disappear after a couple of seconds.</p>
                              
                              <h1>Juggernaut</h1> <p style="font-size:180%;">  
                                The latest killstreak added is a slot 3 killstreak called the 
                                Juggernaut. The Juggernaut can replace the nuke as Slot 3 
                                killstreak and can be called in on a 30 player killstreak. 
                                The killstreak is very different from the classic nuke however, 
                                as it is a whole new weapon just like the Slimer. This weapon quite
                                literally makes the player a Juggernaut, boosting your HP to 2000 
                                no matter what class you are using, and giving you a powerful 
                                minigun that can melt every player in your path with 
                                its impressive rate of fire. However, these upgrades do not come 
                                without any drawbacks, as your movement speed is reduced to about as 
                                slow as an LMG, and jumping is disabled, meaning that bhopping won't be possible. 
                                It's worth mentioning that there's no health regen while the Juggernaut is activated.
                                You either run out of ammunition (250 - no reload) and return to your earlier class, 
                                or you die (run out of health).
