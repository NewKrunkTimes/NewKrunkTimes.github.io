                                  The biggest troll in Krunker history was just pulled off. Solar13 is one of the most influential mapmakers in Krunker, having published several maps such as Parkour+ and Arena+. However, he’s also published loads of custom assets, most notably the krunkie model, which could be found in many parkour maps ever since in-game KR donations were made possible with the help of triggers. For those who aren’t familiar with Krunker Mapmaking, a custom asset is a model that mapmakers can publish for themselves and/or for other mapmakers to use.

                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                When Krunker added the ability to use KR in custom games, there arose a huge market for low effort parkour maps loaded with triggers where you could pay KR to the map creator. Naturally, to make their donation boxes look flashy, players turned to Solar’s KR models and these krunkies quickly became one of the most used custom assets.
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                Solar13 published this set of custom assets over a year ago. All of these assets were models of a different color KR coin (see images above). 
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                Solar13 has made it clear he does not support KR begging and stated in MMOK that players should “Build maps for creative purposes, fulfilling a directive for player enjoyment - not a fictitious currency called KR or purely for self gain, those things don’t provide true value.” Going off of this, Solar was most likely not very happy with his krunkie assets constantly being used for KR begging.
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                Eventually, Solar decided that enough was enough and he took revenge on every KR beg map that used his asset. Solar13 updated the krunkie model, and when a custom asset is updated, every single one of that asset in every single map gets replaced by the updated model. The new model was not another krunkie, rather a small sign. On one side of the sign is an error message saying “Connection Limited” and on the other side is a picture of a sunflower with the quote “I heard growth comes from failures, beggars don’t win, and true seeds sprout from within”. There is a strong resemblance to Solar's quote from before about making maps for creative purposes, and not just to “get rich” in some .IO game.                              
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                Unfortunately, this change affected more than just KR beggars. Quite a few mapmakers used these assets for more meaningful purposes. The mapmaker Alt+F4=Aimbot and many others like him were for example using this asset to give out KR rather than to take it. A bigger map affected by this is JHXC’s Krunkie_Clicker which was not a KR beg map, and was actually made before KR was added to custom games. It used multiple krunkie assets and was ruined by the update. Fortunately, JHXC has good humor about the whole ordeal and says he may consider leaving it the way that it is. 
                              </p>
                              <p style="font-size:180%;">
                                As well as making all these maps look unattractive, this troll brings a lot of awareness to the problem of KR begging in custom maps, and hopefully some beggars will rethink their life choices. Maybe some mapmakers will take Solar’s advice, lighten up on their KR triggers, and start making maps not for some free krunkies, but rather because it’s a lot of fun, giving players something to enjoy. That’s what custom maps were made for in the first place.
