                                 The new Subzero has awoken largely positive reviews by the majority of the Krunker community. Released on the 2nd of May, this map takes a new perspective on the environment of the nostalgic map, with a ski resort theme and a reworking of the church/fountain. On the contrary, many old players aren’t very happy with the change, saying it removes some of the key landmarks of the map.
                              <br><br>
The new Subzero map was made by Jerm Hunter, a prominent member of the map making community that has recently had many of his maps added to the game (e.g. Oasis, Burg V3, Shipment). His new takes on the classic Krunker maps have been characterised by good competitive rotations, a beautiful but very optimized eye for detail, and his habit of staying true to the map’s layout.
<br><br>
Several streamers have critically acclaimed the map, saying the visual upgrade and a more flattened out layout improve the map to the point where “you can’t even think it’s a browser game”. This was said by Kashy Kans, a prominent streamer and YouTuber who has stuck with the game for a considerable amount of time.

There is still a little bit of backlash regarding the rework with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5VoK3WqNr8&ab_channel=PhysicsDontApply" target="_blank"></a>YouTuber even calling the addition of the map “horrendous, you just killed a part of Krunker history”. Most players neglect to bat an eye at this remark, since many think that the visuals weren’t keeping up very well with the newer and reworked maps.
<br><br>

So, will the Subzero map stay in it’s current controversial state? The answer right now is leaning towards a yes, but only time will tell.</p>
